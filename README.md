This repository contains the json files that are read by https://dpaxgdtwis3sd.cloudfront.net/  (has no name yet)

This tool is translated to 11 languages and allows people learning languages to train their hearing to hear and appreciate the true nature of the sounds of the language they are learning. Using Reinforced Learning in a game-like setup, the user learns progresively how the native accent sounds like on many words.

This enables the user to read and pronounce better. Because you cannot imitate a sound (pronounce it) that you are not able to hear well, hearing must come first.

Right now there are only 2 target languages (es-ES and en-GB), but more can be added easily (if the IPA for each word can be found easily).



If you want to collaborate you are welcome!

If you have a github account you can edit the relevant file and submit an issue. Once approved it will be integrated in the main files.

- contents.json : Contains the list of words/sounds.
It needs to be modified if a trueSound (the gold standard) is wrong or if the IPA is wrong too (I would have to re-create the sounds in that case).

- modules.json : You can propose new modules by providing the data structure for it (name & words basically). Please add a little description of why it you think it should be added. If it is for a new language I need the IPA descriptions of those words (you can point me to a web that provides them with high quality, please compare with other places to verify they agree, there is junk in many webs out there).

- translations.json : This may be the file I need most help with. Feel free to edit the file correcting the mistakes.

Thank you all!
