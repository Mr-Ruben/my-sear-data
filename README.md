If you want to collaborate you are welcome!

If you have a github account you can edit the relevant file and submit an issue. Once approved it will be integrated in the main files.

- contents.json : Contains the list of words/sounds.
It needs to be modified if a trueSound (the gold standard) is wrong or if the IPA is wrong too (I would have to re-create the sounds in that case).

- modules.json : You can propose new modules by providing the data structure for it (name & words basically). Please add a little description of why it you think it should be added. If it is for a new language I need the IPA descriptions of those words (you can point me to a web that provides them with high quality, please compare with other places to verify they agree, there is junk in many webs out there).

- translations.json : This may be the file I need most help with. Feel free to edit the file correcting the mistakes.

Thank you all!
